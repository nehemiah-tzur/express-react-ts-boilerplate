# Express, React, TypeScript MonoRepo boilerplate 

Keeping this very bare bones and unopinionated. 

React was setup using Vite. Proxying was set up for /api. 

Express code is all boilerplate.

The project is using Yarn.

yarn dev in the frontend package to start the frontend.
yarn dev in the backend package to start the backend.

This is currently not setup or tested for production.
